<h2>The 3 Best Movies to Watch Right Now</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>Russel Crow goes from a centurian to a slave after he is selected to watch over the Roman Empire.
    the Son of the current Emporer betrays his father and kills his family. Russel's character fights in the gladiator pits
    to rise up once again, and return the Empire to a republic. It's an All-time Classic.

<h3>Resevoir Dogs</h3>
<p>Classic Terantino movie. Cult Classic in fact. This movie is full of dark subject matter, betrayal, and plot twists that keep you on the edge of your seat.
    for the gore and cursing enthusiasts you can always count on quintin to deliver. It's a no-skip everytime.

<h3>The Nightmare Before Christmas</h3>
<p>I used to watch this every night before bed in childhood. Not sure why it's so appealing to my psych.
    Halloween and Christmas are perfectly combined in this classic Tim Burton Tale. The art inspires that shadow of our mind, and we are wisked away to a surreal world.
